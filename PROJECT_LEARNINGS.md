## 1. AI Agent Operating Protocol & Governance (MANDATORY)

Every AI agent working in this codebase must strictly abide by the following operational directives:

1. **The Caution Principle (Never Assume — Always Ask):**
   - This repository houses the public face and digital summit platform of Qiskit Fall Fest 2026.
   - If an event time, speaker name, venue, registration rule, or date is unconfirmed, **never invent details or add placeholder copy**.
   - Cross-check against the companion Planning Repository (`01 _ TECHNICAL & INNOVATION TRACK QFF`) and prompt organizers when in doubt.
2. **Anti-Slop Standards & Engineering Restraint:**
   - **Zero Decorative Emojis:** Never place raw Unicode emojis in code, UI elements, buttons, cards, headers, status badges, toast notifications, error banners, logs, or commit messages (e.g., no emojis like `⚡`, `✨`, `🚀`, `💡`, `✅`, etc.). Use clean SVG icons (such as Lucide) or clean text labels.
   - **Clean Light-Theme Preference:** Default to a crisp, modern light theme (`#ffffff` / `#f8fafc`, subtle borders `#e2e8f0`, legible dark typography `#0f172a`, restrained accents) unless dark theme is explicitly requested. Avoid gratuitous glowing animations or neon halos.
   - **Concise, Functional UI Copy:** Action-oriented, direct labels (`Turn On`, `Refresh`, `Connected`, `Register on Unstop`). Zero corporate AI filler words (*"delve"*, *"tapestry"*, *"landscape"*, *"seamless"*, *"game-changer"*).
   - **Hardware Safety:** Passive monitoring only. Never initiate unsolicited hardware actuation or pulsing.
3. **Route & Architecture Guardrails:**
   - **External Registration Rule:** The "Join/Register" CTA is exclusively an external Unstop destination. Internal routes like `/join`, `/register`, or `/signup` are strictly prohibited.
   - **Component Scoping:** Shared primitives belong in `components/shared/` or `components/ui/`; page-specific compositions belong in `components/pages/[route]/` or `components/[feature]/`.
   - **Data Stores:** All schedules, venue mappings, and event metadata are centralized in `data/`. Do not hardcode static event data inside UI render loops.
4. **Continuous Learning & Logging:**
   - Every AI agent session that implements features, resolves bugs, or updates data **must log its actions** in [Section 6: Chronological Agent Activity Log](#6-chronological-agent-activity-log) before concluding.

## 2. Confirmed Source of Truth (Organizer Ground Truths)

The following operational ground truths were directly reviewed, clarified, and frozen with the festival organizers on **24 September 2026**:

| ID | Operational Area | Confirmed Ground Truth / Decision | Rationale & Practical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GT-01** | **Repository Ecosystem** | **Dual Repository Architecture:**<br>1. *Planning & Governance:* `sahgyan9/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-SRMAP-2026`<br>2. *Production Web Platform:* `qiskitfallfest-srmap/QisKit-Fall-Fest-2026` | Planning repository holds master documents and rubrics; web platform houses the Next.js site deployed to `qffsrmap2026.com`. |
| **GT-02** | **Event 37 Mode** | **OFFLINE (Physical)**. Conducted in the **Auditorium for 8 hours**. | QCTF (Quantum Capture the Flag) is an on-campus offline competition, not an online CTF. |
| **GT-03** | **Infeasible Events** | **Event 11, Event 32, and Event 53 are officially INFEASIBLE.** | Event 11 (*Hardware Challenges*), Event 32 (*Quantum Go*), and Event 53 (*Quantum Magnetometry*) cannot be supported. |
| **GT-04** | **Event 11 Disposal** | **DROPPED entirely.** | Formally excised from the active portfolio to prevent laboratory resource overcommitments. |
| **GT-05** | **Online Phase Timeline** | **Staggered Two-Tier Structure:**<br>• **Oct 5–9:** Masterclass learning courses & workshops.<br>• **Oct 9–13:** Hackathon Phase 1 problem sprint + online games.<br>• **Oct 13 (11:59 PM IST):** Phase 1 final submission deadline.<br>• **Oct 14–16:** Technical Review Window.<br>• **Oct 17 (Night):** Finalist Announcement (~200 participants). | Masterclasses finish on Oct 9; participants then apply learnings to their hackathon problem statements until Oct 13 while playing casual online games. |
| **GT-06** | **Phase 2 Onsite Hackathon** | **Scheduled for 27–28 October 2026** (24–26 hours in Auditorium). | Slotted within the 26–30 Oct Offline Phase; avoids Day 1 (Oct 26 travel fatigue) and final day (Oct 30 evaluation & closing expo). |
| **GT-07** | **Event 21 Title & Format** | **`QTalk - Question – 2-Minute Quantum Talk`** | Emphasizes direct audience and participant Q&A with speakers. |
| **GT-08** | **Unstop Public Launch** | **Target Date: 25 September 2026.** | Public registration listings and external URLs will be wired once released. |
| **GT-09** | **Campus WiFi DNS Sinkhole & Alternative Mirror** | **Diagnosed: Campus Check Point Gateway Sinkhole (`62.0.58.94`). Official Fallback / Campus Mirror: `https://qis-kit-fall-fest-2026.vercel.app/`.** | The SRM-AP campus firewall (Check Point) intercepts DNS queries for newly registered domain `qffsrmap2026.com` and sinkholes them to `62.0.58.94`, triggering `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`. ITKM whitelist request is scheduled for Monday.<br><br>**Production Workarounds:**<br>1. **Campus / General Users:** Distribute and use the live, verified Vercel production mirror `https://qis-kit-fall-fest-2026.vercel.app/` which operates natively without blockage across campus WiFi, labs, and student dorms.<br>2. **Developer Client Bypass:** Enable Secure DNS (DoH via Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 or Google) in browser settings to resolve `qffsrmap2026.com` directly.<br>3. **External / Mobile Users:** Access `https://www.qffsrmap2026.com/` directly on mobile data or non-campus ISP connections. |
| **GT-10** | **Side-by-side Markdown Files** | **Standardized Markdown (`.md`) files** right next to proprietary source documents in planning repository. | Eliminates token waste and supports direct agent ingestion. |
| **GT-11** | **Dynamic LLMs Manifest Synchronization** | **Automated generation and verification of `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and `public/docs/*.md` via `tools/generate_llms_manifests.py` and `tools/verify_llms_manifests.py`.** | Mandates that whenever schedules, rubrics, curricula, or event cards are updated, agents must recompile and verify the LLM manifest suite. Guarantees zero hallucinations and zero token waste for external search engines and internal agents. |
| **GT-12** | **Technical SEO & Google Site Name Protocol** | **Brand Name strictly locked to `Qiskit Fall Fest SRMAP 2026` across JSON-LD `WebSite` schema, `og:site_name`, and `<title>` prefixes.** | Guarantees Google displays the exact brand name and favicon above the search snippet, preventing host domain hijack ("Vercel") or bare domain fallback. Follows `docs/TECHNICAL_SEO_STANDARDS.md`. |
| **GT-13** | **Official SRM University-AP Event Portal Association** | **Official Institutional Event Listing: `https://events.srmap.edu.in/event/qiskit-fall-fest-2026/`. Primary Web Platform: `https://www.qffsrmap2026.com/`.** | Excises erroneous legacy subdomain placeholders (`qiskitfallfest2026.srmap.edu.in`) and wires university-level endorsement into Organization & Event schemas. |
| **GT-14** | **Alpha Matting & Favicon Suite Protocol** | **Brand logos and favicons must never be bounded inside arbitrary solid square boxes.** | Mandates transparent alpha padding to output crisp PNGs/ICOs (`favicon.ico`, `icon.png`, `apple-icon.png`, `icon-48.png`, `icon-192.png`, `qff-srmap-logo.png`). Updated to official dual-lobed Qiskit Fall Fest 2026 emblem; legacy v1 circular organizing badge archived in `archive/legacy-favicons/`. Guarantees Google Search and browser tabs render a clean transparent icon. |
| **GT-15** | **Two-Tier Staggered Schedule Phrasing** | **Never publish a monolithic 25-day date span (e.g. `Oct 5–30`) on public cards, metadata, or share banners.** | Eliminates attendee fatigue and confusion regarding continuous attendance. Always formulate as: `Online: Oct 5–9 | Offline: Oct 26–30 (Amaravati)`. |
| **GT-16** | **Vercel Deployment Storage & Asset Hygiene Standard** | **Cumulative Deployment Storage stabilized at 961.65 MB (<10% of 10 GB Hobby limit) via 1-day retention policy and 7.71 MB static payload.** | Enforced 1-day deployment retention policy across team/project settings and compressed venue photography from 37.3 MB to 2.3 MB. Total static upload footprint reduced to 7.71 MB per build. Follows `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_VERCEL_SUPABASE.md`. |
| **GT-17** | **Supabase Cloud Infrastructure & Database Architecture** | **Primary Backend: Supabase project `jpciyrodeppqpkwqblpk` (PostgreSQL 17, `ap-southeast-2`).** | Synchronized with Vercel environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`). Provisioned `media` public storage bucket for asset CDN offloading, and `public.registrations` table with Row Level Security (RLS) for attendee/event RSVPs. Client helper initialized at `lib/supabase.ts`. |
| **GT-18** | **Environment Secret Hygiene & Metadata Route Isolation** | **Never commit hardcoded JWT/API keys to Git. Prevent App Router / public file metadata collisions. Avoid concurrent dev/build execution.** | 1. **Secret Separation:** Keep Supabase credentials strictly inside `.env.local` (enforced as gitignored) and Vercel environment variables. Even public `anon` JWT keys must never be hardcoded into tracked files (`lib/supabase.ts`) to avoid secret scanning alerts, key rotation bottlenecks, and exposure risks.<br>2. **App Router Metadata Exclusivity:** When using Next.js App Router metadata conventions (`app/favicon.ico`), never retain conflicting duplicate static files in `public/` (e.g. `public/favicon.ico`). Next.js detects duplicate route collisions and returns `500 Internal Server Error: A conflicting public file and page file was found for path /favicon.ico`.<br>3. **Build Cache Isolation:** Never run `next build` while a `next dev` instance is running in the background. Concurrent read/write operations against `.next/` corrupt webpack runtime chunks (`ENOENT: routes-manifest.json`, missing `xxx.js`). Always stop active dev instances before executing builds. |
| **GT-19** | **Academic Certification & Razorpay Gateway Architecture** | **Server-side Zero-Trust Eligibility Gate, Dual-Channel Idempotent Webhook Verification, Tamper-Proof SHA-256 Hashing, and Immutable Supabase Storage Minting.** | 1. **Zero-Trust Eligibility:** Never trust client parameters for credential issuance. Server must independently query `user_progress` (all 6 lectures watched + all 6 quizzes passed) and `competition_submissions` (all 3 daily challenges submitted) before creating a Razorpay order.<br>2. **Dual-Channel Payment Verification:** Implement both synchronous client callback verification (`/api/learning/certificate/verify`) for immediate UI response and asynchronous webhook processing (`/api/payment/webhook` for `payment.captured`) using HMAC-SHA256 signatures to handle mobile browser suspensions and network drop-offs.<br>3. **Idempotency & Uniqueness:** Enforce database constraints (`UNIQUE (user_email, course_name)`) to guarantee a candidate is never charged twice or issued duplicate certificates.<br>4. **Public QR Verification:** Every certificate is minted with a canonical serial (`QFF26-MCL-202610-XXXX`), cryptographic SHA-256 hash, and permanent CDN URL in Supabase Storage (`certificates` bucket) verifiable at `/verify-certificate/[serial]`. Follows `docs/plan.md`. |

| **2026-09-25 07:46** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | README accuracy update: clarified ecosystem scale vs host scope | `README.md`, `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` | Reconciled phrasing conflation regarding "200 global institutions"; clarified that the platform powers SRM University-AP's flagship edition within IBM Quantum's global 200+ host institution network rather than serving all 200 institutions directly. |
| **2026-09-25 07:57** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Comprehensive overhaul and expansion of LLMs manifest suite (llms.txt, llms-full.txt, public/docs/*.md) | `tools/generate_llms_manifests.py`, `tools/verify_llms_manifests.py`, `workflows/update_llms_manifests.md`, `public/llms.txt`, `public/llms-full.txt`, `public/docs/*.md`, `public/robots.txt`, `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` | Replaced 39-line stub with llmstxt.org v2 standard index and comprehensive 31k-char llms-full.txt dossier. Built deterministic generation and verification tooling in tools/, authored SOP workflow in workflows/, exported standalone markdown endpoints to public/docs/, updated robots.txt, and synchronized across both web and planning repositories. |
| **2026-09-25 08:33** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Comprehensive Technical SEO & Google Site Name optimization | `config/seo.ts`, `components/shared/JsonLd.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `config/page-release.ts`, `app/*/page.tsx`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `public/robots.txt`, `public/manifest.json`, favicons & OG assets, `docs/TECHNICAL_SEO_STANDARDS.md`, `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` | Implemented full Google Site Name architecture (`Qiskit Fall Fest SRMAP 2026`), multi-size 48px+ favicons, JSON-LD schemas (WebSite, Organization, EventSeries, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage), automatic noindex guards on coming-soon pages, synchronized sitemaps and robots, redirected registration paths to official event portal, and authored master documentation for future AI agents. |
| **2026-09-25 09:05** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Campus DNS sinkhole diagnosis and production fallback mirror integration | `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`, `README.md`, `config/seo.ts`, `tools/generate_llms_manifests.py`, `public/llms.txt`, `public/llms-full.txt`, `public/docs/faq.md` | Diagnosed `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR` on campus WiFi as Check Point firewall DNS sinkhole (`62.0.58.94`) intercepting newly registered domain `qffsrmap2026.com`. Discovered and verified live Vercel production deployment `https://qis-kit-fall-fest-2026.vercel.app/` which works natively without blockage on campus WiFi. Updated master docs, SEO config, README, and LLM manifests to guide future agents and provide immediate alternative endpoints for campus registrations. |
| **2026-09-25 19:15** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Vercel Deployment Storage remediation and Supabase cloud backend integration | `.vercelignore`, `.env.local`, `lib/supabase.ts`, `package.json`, `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_VERCEL_SUPABASE.md`, `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` | Diagnosed 75% Deployment Storage alert on Vercel as cumulative retention of 38 deployments. Deleted 34 stale/failed/preview deployments via Vercel REST API, reclaiming ~12.9 GB. Authored `.vercelignore` to strip >137 MB of root PNGs and unreferenced mockups per build. Connected Supabase project (`jpciyrodeppqpkwqblpk`), synchronized environment variables across all Vercel environments, installed `@supabase/supabase-js`, provisioned public `media` storage bucket, created `public.registrations` table with RLS, and verified 100% clean Next.js 15 production build. |
| **2026-09-26 11:55** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Vercel Deployment Retention policy hardening & venue asset compression | `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`, `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_VERCEL_SUPABASE.md`, `.vercelignore`, `public/images/venues/*` | Enforced 1-day deployment retention policy across canceled, errored, pre-production, and production builds in Vercel settings, pruning cumulative storage down to 961.65 MB (<10% of 10 GB limit). Compressed 37.3 MB of raw venue photography down to 2.3 MB web JPEGs and expanded `.vercelignore` to exclude duplicate hero/hosted-at paths, shrinking total static build payload from 407.45 MB to 7.71 MB (98.1% reduction). |
| **2026-09-26 12:01** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Vercel Deployment Storage official reset verified (961.65 MB / 10 GB) | `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`, `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_VERCEL_SUPABASE.md` | Confirmed live Vercel Usage dashboard reset from 8.07 GB (amber warning) to 961.65 MB (blue healthy state). Verified 1-day retention policy propagation and full build payload optimization across production. |
| **2026-09-29 23:25** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Resolved dev server crash, metadata route collision, and secret separation | `lib/supabase.ts`, `public/favicon.ico`, `.env.local`, `package.json`, `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` | Diagnosed Next.js 15 dev crashes: (1) Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` causing `createClient` to throw in SSR; provisioned local `.env.local` and hardened `lib/supabase.ts` with fallback handling while ensuring zero hardcoded secrets in source files. (2) Removed duplicate `public/favicon.ico` to eliminate collision with App Router metadata `app/favicon.ico`. (3) Verified package dependencies and codified GT-18 for future AI agents. |
| **2026-09-30 01:20** | Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash) | Built Masterclass Certification Engine with Razorpay Gateway & Verification | `docs/plan.md`, `lib/razorpay.ts`, `lib/certificate.ts`, `app/api/learning/certificate/*`, `app/api/payment/webhook/*`, `app/verify-certificate/*`, `components/learning/CertificateModal.tsx`, `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` | Designed and implemented end-to-end masterclass certification system: (1) Server-side zero-trust academic eligibility gate (6 lectures + 6 quizzes + 3 daily challenges). (2) Razorpay checkout order creation & dual-channel verification (synchronous client callback + HMAC-SHA256 webhook). (3) Provisioned `certificate_orders`, `issued_certificates` tables in Supabase and `certificates` storage bucket. (4) Built dynamic SVG credential minting, public QR verification portal (`/verify-certificate/[serial]`), and interactive Learning Hub checkout modal. Codified GT-19. |
